<p>CHAMPS is Ngee Ann Secondary’s Humanities and English Language Talent
Development Programme. It aims to stretch and sharpen students’ critical
thinking, writing, speaking and reading skills by exposing them to multiple
perspectives and skillsets that contribute towards moulding quality, well-rounded
students of the Humanities and the English Language.</p>
<h3>Structure of the programme</h3>
<p>CHAMPS is a three-year programme that offers students an enriched curriculum
focused on higher order development in the disciplines.</p>
<h5>Eligibility Criteria</h5>
<p>Secondary One students are invited to join CHAMPS based on their PSLE
English Language and WA1 results. Students should demonstrate aptitude
and interest in the Humanities and English Language along with positive
learning dispositions.</p>
<p>CHAMPS students may continue to be eligible for the Sec 2 CHAMPS programme
based on their language and humanities results, attendance and degree of
participation during the Sec 1 CHAMPS programme. New students may also
be considered at the end of Secondary One, subject to their results, teacher
recommendations, passion for Humanities and languages, and available vacancies.</p>
<p>Students who are selected to be part of the programme will be involved
in weekly training sessions where they will learn the skills and strategies
to effectively participate in inter-school Mock United Nations Conferences,
Writing and Broadcast Journalism Workshops, Research in the Social Sciences
and other Humanities seminars and competitions. These may include Humanities
Symposium at the JCs, MOE’s Creative Arts Programme and NUS Geography Challenge,
etc. All CHAMPS students will also be empowered to be effective thinkers,
communicators and collaborators through Communications and Design Thinking
modules curated for them.</p>
<p>Our CHAMPS students organise our very own NAS Mock United Nations where
they plan, run and facilitate debates and discussions among students of
different schools, who attend NASMUN as country delegates putting forth
their respective positions. Through this process, the students acquire
leadership, perspective taking skills, empathy, and hone their persuasion
and communication skills.</p>

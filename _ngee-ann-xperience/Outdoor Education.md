<p>Outdoor Education @ NAS aims to help students develop a multitude of outdoor
knowledge, skills and attitudes that enable them to explore and enjoy the
natural and urban environments safely, confidently and responsibly. It
will contribute towards moulding our Leaders of Character.</p>
<h3>Structure of the programme</h3>
<p>Outdoor Education @ NAS is tiered and segmented in order to organise relevant
and appropriate learning. We use authentic settings to engage students’
senses, presenting them with opportunities for problem-solving and decision-making,
both individually and in groups. Students experience real consequences
of their actions and decisions that affect themselves, the environment
and the people around them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>OE is incorporated into PE lessons for all students. Secondary One students
will experience a residential camp while Secondary Three students partake
in an adventure-based camp. The Secondary Two students will apply their
learning during the OE week. The apogee experience is where a few selected
Secondary Three students undertake a challenging expedition to cap the
OE experience.</p>

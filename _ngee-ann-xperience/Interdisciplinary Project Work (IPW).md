<p>IPW is a lower secondary programme which develops students’ capacity to
think laterally across disciplines to see interconnections, and also hone
their inquisitiveness and imagination as they engage with and attempt to
address current social issues from multiple lenses. Through creative problem

adaptive and inventive thinking skills.</p>

<p>SPARKS is Ngee Ann Secondary’s Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics
(STEM) Talent Development Programme. Through SPARKS, we nurture collaborative
and resilient innovators who develop impactful solutions for the community.</p>
<h3>Structure of the programme</h3>
<p>The programme is designed to progressively develop students’ STEM skills:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Secondary One: Students are introduced to Design Thinking and Communication
Skills. They also embark on learning journeys to broaden their understanding
of STEM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondary Two: Students develop their STEM research skills and have the
opportunities to start applying their knowledge to real-world projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upper Secondary: Students further refine their STEM research and interdisciplinary
skills by participating in advanced programmes and competitions. These
could be in partnership with universities such as Singapore University
of Technology and Design (SUTD), where students receive mentorship, collaborate
with community partners, and propose solutions that create real-world impact.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Eligibility Criteria for SPARKS</h3>
<p>Secondary One students are invited to join SPARKS based on their PSLE
Mathematics and Science and WA1 results. Students should demonstrate aptitude

<h3>CO-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES</h3>
<p><strong>WHY CCA?</strong>
</p>
<p>Co-curricular Activities (CCAs) are an integral part of our students’
holistic development and a natural platform for students to learn values,
develop life skills such as leadership, teamwork, time management as well
as 21st Century Competencies to equip them for the future.</p>
<p>CCA is also where our students develop their character and mental resilience.
It offers the platform for students to extend their non-academic passion
or talent, and possibly discover and develop a life-long interest.</p>
<p>Many NASisans would agree that CCA is where friendships are made, camaraderie
is forged, memories are weaved and a sense of belonging and identity are
engendered. This is why NASians love their CCAs and pursue them with verve
and passion. While as a national policy, participation in CCAs is mandatory
for secondary students, NASians attend CCAs because they want to! CCAs
add colour to the NASian school experience and are a vital part of our
vibrant and dynamic campus life! Come feel the pulse of the CCA experience
at NAS!</p>

<p><em>Diagram 1: Our goals of CCA are shaped by (a) our school’s mission, vision and values, (b) MOE’s Desired Outcomes of Education, the (c) outcomes of secondary school education, and (d) MOE’s overarching goals for CCA.</em>
</p>
<p><strong>CCAs nurture the whole child.</strong>
</p>
<p>CCAs are crucial student development experiences that contribute towards
the holistic development of our students in the physical, aesthetic, intellectual,
moral and social domains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, CCA develops the whole child.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CCAs contribute towards MOE’s Desired Outcomes of Education and Goals
for CCAs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At NAS, CCA is a key platform to develop all NASians towards our desired
student outcomes of Future-Ready Learners and Forward-Looking Leaders,
in our School of Possibilities and Home to Grow In.</p>
<p><strong>HOW CCAs ARE CARRIED OUT</strong>

<p><em>Diagram 2: Delivering our CCA. We strive to align intentional design of CCA with meaningful enactment and guide our students to make the connection between their learning and their lived experiences for authentic learning.</em>
</p>
<p><strong>THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CCA GROUPS AND CCAS IN NAS</strong>
</p>
<p>We have a total of 18 CCAs under the four categories: Physical Sports,
Uniformed Groups, Performing Arts, and Clubs &amp; Societies. The wide
array of CCAs on offer serves to meet the diverse interests of our students.
Generally, NASians are able to enter a CCA within their top few choices.</p>
<p>We are confident that there will be a CCA you can join, enjoy, learn,
grow and enjoy in, even if it was not your first choice of CCA!</p>
<p>While we strive to meet the diverse needs of the students, there is a
quota in the number of members each CCA can offer, whether due to physical
or pedagogical constraints. This is to ensure that the quality of learning
and safety of our students are not compromised.</p>

<p><em>Diagram 3: The activities that make up a CCA.</em>
</p>
<p>Each CCA is unique. Each CCA offers its unique blend of activities and
learning that make up the full experience and benefits to students of belonging
to the CCA. Other than the main CCA experiential sessions, CCAs may have
(a) competitions for students to apply what they learnt in the real world,
(b) participation opportunities to contribute to school events, (c) the
chance to participate in and to lead camping experiences, (d) workshops
and learning journeys to widen their learning experiences, € collaboration
with external organisations to provide service contributions, and (f) engagements
with external stakeholders to widen their exposure.</p>
<h3>PHYSICAL SPORTS</h3>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:70%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/CCA%20Sports.jpg">
</div>
<p>In physical sports CCA, students develop a love for an active and healthy
lifestyle through their sport, develop physical and mental robustness and
learn about sportsmanship.</p>
<h3>Uniformed Groups</h3>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:70%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/CCA%20Uniformed%20Group.jpg">
</div>
<p>In uniformed groups CCA, we aim to make good citizens of students by inculcating
in them self-reliance, resilience, discipline and a spirit of service to
others. Specifically, we want them</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp; To be leaders of character: Leadership development courses
impart to students the basics of leading others. They are regularly given
opportunities to take on leadership roles, such as organising camps and
events, and purposefully designing activities to help their juniors grow
as individuals.</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp; To be community carers: To create a strong culture of
mentorship, wherein senior members exercise care and concern for their
juniors and nurture them to succeed the leadership of the unit. Through
these practices, our students become youth leaders of outstanding moral
fibre.</p>
<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp; To put others before self: Students are also encouraged
to look beyond oneself and to develop a spirit of compassion and care for
others. They often take the initiative and use their knowledge and skills
for the betterment of the wider community. They engage in advocacy work
that moves others to action, and their exemplary conduct makes them role
models for their peers and juniors.</p>
<h3>PERFORMING ARTS</h3>

</div>
<p>The performing arts CCA nurture in students a sense of graciousness and
an appreciation for the rich culture and heritage of our multi-racial society.
Specifically, through the CCA, students</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp; Develop a lively curiosity and an inquisitive mind. This
is essential as it promotes inventive thinking and an innovative orientation
in what they do.</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp; Strengthen their sense of aesthetics, which is the basis
of how they perceive the world at large and all that is around them. Such
a perspective helps them make meaning of their lives, culture and identity.</p>
<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp; Instil resilience and forge develop character, as the
continuum of authentic experiences allow them to develop, reflect on, and
apply the values, competencies and skills that will help them thrive in
the future.</p>

</div>
<p>In clubs and societies CCA, students explore and extend their interests
in wide-ranging and specialised areas which may be knowledge-based or skills-based.
Specifically, students</p>
<p>(1) Discover their interests: Expose students to wide-ranging activities
so as to discover their strengths and what excites.</p>
<p>(2) Develop a passion for their interests: Enthuse the students to champion
for their interests.</p>

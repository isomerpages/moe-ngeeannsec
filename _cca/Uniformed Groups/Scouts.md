<h3>About Us</h3>
<p><strong>VISION: What does the CCA want to achieve?&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Better Scouting for more young People.</p>
<p><strong>MISSION</strong>: <strong>What does the CCA set out to do?</strong>
</p>
<p>The mission of Scouting is to contribute to the education of young people,
through a value system based on the Scout Promise and Law, to help build
a better world where people are self-fulfilled as individuals and play
a constructive role in society. This is achieved by:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>involving them throughout their formative years in a non-formal educational
process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using a specific method that makes each individual the principal agent
of his or her development as a self-reliant, supportive, responsible and
committed person</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>assisting them to establish a value system based upon spiritual, social
and personal principles as expressed in the Promise and Law</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>LEARNING OUTCOMES: By the time the students leave the CCA, what characteristics do they exhibit?</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students will be able to learn by doing through the use of practical actions
(real life experiences) and reflection(s) to facilitate ongoing learning
and development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students will be exposed to nature and gain learning opportunities in
the outdoors which encourage a better understanding of and a relationship
with the wider environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students will learn to work within a team system; the use of small teams
as a way to participate in collaborative learning, with the aim of developing
effective teamwork, inter-personal skills, leadership, as well as building
a sense of responsibility and belonging.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>LEARNING INDICATORS: How do we know our students have learnt?</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>At various junctures of the Scout Progress Scheme, the Scouts should be
able to each demonstrate their learning to the unit leaders, in alignment
to the stages of the Progress Scheme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scouts will keep track of their personal progression; a progressive learning
journey focused on motivating and challenging an individual to continually
develop, through a wide variety of learning opportunities. e.g. Scouts
will keep a personal file which documents their attendance, achievements,
community involvement programmes, reflections, and to store documents such
as training schedules, and documents indicating the ways in which to attain
proficiency and progress badges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within the patrol system, the students should demonstrate a good sense
of belonging to the functions of the patrol. These patrols should actively
engage in the planning and execution of various tasks like campsite development
and pioneering.</p>
</li>

### About Us

**VISION**: What does the CCA want to achieve?&nbsp;

Better Scouting for more young People.  

  

**MISSION**: What does the CCA set out to do?

The mission of Scouting is to contribute to the education of young people, through a value system based on the Scout Promise and Law, to help build a better world where people are self-fulfilled as individuals and play a constructive role in society. This is achieved by:&nbsp;  

• involving them throughout their formative years in a non-formal educational process

• using a specific method that makes each individual the principal agent of his or her development as a self-reliant, supportive, responsible and committed person

• assisting them to establish a value system based upon spiritual, social and personal principles as expressed in the Promise and Law

  

**LEARNING OUTCOMES**: By the time the students leave the CCA, what characteristics do they exhibit?

(1) Students will be able to learn by doing through the use of practical actions (real life experiences) and reflection(s) to facilitate ongoing learning and development.&nbsp;  

(2) Students will be exposed to nature and gain learning opportunities in the outdoors which encourage a better understanding of and a relationship with the wider environment.  

(3) Students will learn to work within a team system; the use of small teams as a way to participate in collaborative learning, with the aim of developing effective teamwork, inter-personal skills, leadership, as well as building a sense of responsibility and belonging.

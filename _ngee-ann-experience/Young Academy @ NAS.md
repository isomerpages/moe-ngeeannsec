<h4>YANAS is implemented through:</h4>
<p><strong>The Skills Discovery Electives (SDE) program</strong>
</p>
<p>SDE offers a diverse array of electives for Secondary 1 to 3 students
to choose from. Each elective consists of seven one-hour sessions designed
to provide students with exposure to various fields, helping them discover
their strengths and potential. The electives cover a wide range of interests,
including aesthetics, business &amp; finance, cultural &amp; language,
digital, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), and
sports.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Applied Learning Modules (ApLM)</strong>
</p>
<p>Applied Learning Modules (ApLM) are designed to complement the Secondary
curriculum through their focus on the practical application of knowledge.
The ApLM provide students with hands-on, applied learning opportunities
- learning that involves doing and applying, learning about the real world,
and learning for life. ApLM@Poly also provide students with taster experiences
of learning in a polytechnic and can contribute to helping them make more
informed decisions for their post-secondary education.</p>
<p>By integrating these approaches, <strong>YouNG</strong> Academy @ NAS (YANAS)
aims to create a more engaging, personalized, and practical educational
experience for students, preparing them for lifelong learning and success
in their future endeavours.</p>

Ngee Ann Secondary is proud to be an Extraordinary School that provides Extraordinary Experiences for our students. We aim to inculcate a love for learning among all our students through unique programmes that give them the opportunity to go beyond the written word in the textbooks and experience learning in authentic environments. By participating in these programmes, every NASian should develop a more positive attitude towards learning and actively construct meaning by drawing links between what is taught in the classrooms to real-world experiences. They should also better understand their roles as individuals in a larger society and actively set out to make positive changes in the community that they are a part of.

<p>SPARKS is Ngee Ann Secondary’s Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics
(STEM) Talent Development Programme. Through SPARKS, we nurture collaborative
and resilient innovators who develop impactful solutions for the community.</p>
<h3>Structure of the programme</h3>
<p>The programme is designed to progressively develop students’ STEM skills:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Secondary One: Students are introduced to Design Thinking and Communication
Skills. They also embark on learning journeys to broaden their understanding
of STEM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondary Two: Students develop their STEM research skills and have the
opportunities to start applying their knowledge to real-world projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upper Secondary: Students further refine their STEM research and interdisciplinary
skills by participating in advanced programmes and competitions. One such
opportunity is STEAMunity, a programme by the Singapore University of Technology
and Design (SUTD), where students receive mentorship, collaborate with
community partners, and propose solutions that create real-world impact.</p>

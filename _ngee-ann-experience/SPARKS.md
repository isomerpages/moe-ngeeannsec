SPARKS is Ngee Ann Secondary's Science and Mathematics Talent Development Programme. It follows a broad-based curriculum where innovative and interesting teaching methods are used and classes are held in technologically-rich rooms. Emphasis is given towards higher level cognitive and learning skills, such as critical thinking, independent learning, problem-solving, formal writing, and research and development.

  

### Structure of the programme

The SPARKS Programme is a three-year programme.

It comprises Scientific Critical Thinking, Drones and Science Research. Trainings for various competitions, including the Olympiads will also be offered to students. Students will embark on a SPARKS trip to Australia in Year 3 with our partner school.

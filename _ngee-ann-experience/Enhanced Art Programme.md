The Enhanced Art Programme aims to provide a platform for passionate student artists to hone their craft. In line with the school vision “An Icon of Excellence and The Pride of the Community”, the Programme seeks to develop in students greater aesthetic awareness, critical and creative thinking skills, an inquiring attitude, and art concepts and skills.

### Structure of the programme

The Enhanced Art Programme is a 2 year Upper Secondary Programme (Express). Students who are interested in the programme will have to attend a 3 day Selection Workshop. The EAP allows for more engaged learning through the use of effective pedagogy, in particular the Inquiry Based pedagogical approach and Artful Thinking Routines. To create better career awareness, EAP Students are exposed to various media such as Film and Digital Painting during the course. EAP Students get the opportunities to participate in collaborative workshops and internships.

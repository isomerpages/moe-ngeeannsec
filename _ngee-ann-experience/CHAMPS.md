CHAMPS is Ngee Ann Secondary's Humanities and English Language Talent Development Programme. It aims to stretch and sharpen students' critical thinking, writing, speaking and reading skills by exposing them to multiple perspectives and skillsets that contribute towards moulding quality, well-rounded students of the Humanities and the English Language.   

  

### Structure of the programme

CHAMPS is a three-year programme that offers students an enriched curriculum focused on higher order development in the disciplines.   

  

  

##### Eligibility Criteria

Students who have scored AL1 or AL2 in English Language and are among the top third of the Express cohort by the PSLE subject ranked list for the English Language may be eligible for the CHAMPS programme. The CHAMPS students may continue to be eligible for the Sec 2 CHAMPS programme based on their language and humanities results, attendance and degree of participation during the Sec 1 CHAMPS programmes. New students may also enrol at the end of Sec 1 for the Sec 2 CHAMPS programme, in part or whole, based on their results and/or teachers’ recommendations of their aptitude and passion.

Students who are selected to be part of the programme will be involved in weekly training sessions where they will learn the skills and strategies to effectively participate in inter-school Mock United Nations Conferences, Global Scholars Programme, Creative Writing and Broadcast Journalism Classes, Philosophy Classes, Debating Classes and other Humanities seminars and competitions.

CHAMPS students will also get the opportunity to collaborate with students from other schools in the NAS MUN and have the chance to participate in overseas Humanities field trips in Secondary 2.

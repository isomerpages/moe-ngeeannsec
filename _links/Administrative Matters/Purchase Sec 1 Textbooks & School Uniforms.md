### If eligible for Subject-Based Banding (SBB)

Parents/guardians of **Sec 1 Normal Academic / Technical students who are eligible for SBB** should purchase your child/ward’s school textbooks **after** attending the **Sec 1 Registration Briefing via Zoom** on Thursday 22 December 2022.

We will use PG to send the Zoom webinar link and passcode to you **on Wednesday 21 December 2022, by 7pm**.

The information shared during the briefing will help you to make a more informed decision about whether to accept or reject the SBB offer. The decision you make will then affect the list of school textbooks that you need to purchase.

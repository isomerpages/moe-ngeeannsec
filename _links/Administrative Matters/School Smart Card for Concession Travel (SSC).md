*   Please be informed that all students entering Secondary 1 in January 2023 can continue using their Primary level School Smart Cards (SSCs) for concessionary travel until end April 2023. They will be issued with new Secondary level SSCs in due course.
*   &nbsp;Students can still purchase the Bus Concession Pass (BCP) using their Primary level SSCs but they would need to&nbsp;**purchase the BCP for Secondary School students**.
*   Students may request for an immediate refund of any remaining travel value for their Primary level SSCs at any TransitLink Ticket Office between January to April 2023. To collect the refund, please bring&nbsp;along:  
    

*   **Singapore Citizen / Permanent Resident:**&nbsp;Original NRIC/passport&nbsp;**OR**
*   **Foreigners:**&nbsp;Original Re-entry Permit/Student Pass (FIN)&nbsp;**AND**
*   **Representative’s original NRIC/passport**&nbsp;(if someone else is collecting for you)

*   When students’ Primary level SSCs expire in end April 2023, they cannot be refunded immediately. TransitLink will issue a receipt for any applicable refund, which can be collected at any TransitLink Ticket Office after five working days. The refund of the Primary level SSC is not allowed while the concession is still valid.

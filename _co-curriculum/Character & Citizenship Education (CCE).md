Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) has always been at the heart of education in Singapore. Various key programmes such as Civics and Moral Education (CME,1992), National Education (NE,1997), the Community Involvement Programme (CIP,1997), and Social and Emotional Learning (SEL,2005) have been put in place to inculcate values and build competencies in our pupils to develop them into good individuals and useful citizens. CCE enables the students to understand (head), care about (heart) and act on (hands) core ethical values such as respect, resilience, integrity, care, commitment and responsibility for self and others. CCE also equips them with the knowledge, skills and values needed for the VUCA world. Since students spend much of their time in schools, we need to seize opportunity so that the students will Learn while the teachers, Inculcate and Foster Ethics Education. \[L.I.F.E\]  

  

L.I.F.E@ NAS has undergone a review to incorporate the updated CCE 2021 curriculum. The revised L.I.F.E@ Ngee Ann includes components of Sexuality Education, National Education, Mental Health, Family Education, Cyber Wellness as well as Values-In-Action.

  

As we deliver L.I.F.E@ NAS, we make a conscious effort to engage our students’ head, heart and hands. The L.I.F.E@ NAS curriculum include activities and lessons that influence the students’ emotions because learning is not only a mental process, but that it is also influenced by one’s feelings. (Jensen,2003). We believe that students will only give significance to what they are learning if they have strong feelings about or believe in something.

  

As our students go through L.I.F.E@ NAS, they will be given the opportunity to be able to form views, have the conviction and courage to stay by their views, yet be prepared to revise them in the face of better substantiated views and articulate their views and lead self/others to act.

In Ngee Ann, Design Thinking which is a systematic process of thinking which empowers students to develop new, innovative solutions to the problem at hand is infused into Values in Action (VIA). Our students apply the creative problem solving method of Design Thinking in their VIA Project as they serve their beneficiaries which have been intentionally selected.

The school aims to provide real and authentic experiences for the students through the different CCE activities such as NE commemorative celebrations as well as work attachment / shadowing experiences.

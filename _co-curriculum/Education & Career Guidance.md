<p>Education and Career Guidance (ECG) helps students to develop a sense
of purpose in life. By nurturing self-awareness and self-directedness for
lifelong learning, ECG helps students to develop a growth mindset, adaptability
and a resilient attitude to embrace future opportunities and appreciate
the value of all occupations.</p>
<h2><strong>The ECG Developmental Model</strong></h2>
<p>The ECG Developmental Model (see Figure 1) is a framework that guides
schools in programming developmentally appropriate ECG activities for students
at different levels. The model highlights education and career development
as a process that takes place over one’s life span, with three progressive
emphases of Awareness, Exploration and Planning. Awareness, Exploration
and Planning are necessary for all levels of students. However, there are
different emphases at the different levels to meet varying developmental
needs.</p>

<p>The emphasis in Secondary School is in the Exploration stage which includes:
<br>a) Awareness of skills, interests and values.
<br>b) Awareness of relevant courses of study and educational pathways.
<br>c) Exploring the world of work.

Every NASian, a SUPER youth.

In Ngee Ann Secondary School, we believe that every student has the potential to be developed into a leader. The school strives to develop our student leaders into forward-looking individuals by embarking them on projects in their chosen areas of concern, based on their strengths and interests.&nbsp;

The intent is to bring out their personal voice and creativity, as they think and plan ahead and actively solve problems by coming up with their own solutions. We also encourage them to initiate their own projects to serve the school or the community. All these will make sure that our students remain grounded in sound values and practise good work ethics.&nbsp;

The school adopts the Kouzes and Posner’s Leadership Challenge Model in designing our student leadership practice. We aspire for our student leaders to be SUPER - “Selfless” and “Unafraid”, and to be a “Problem-solver” and an “Excellent Role model”.

Leadership Training and Opportunities

Every NASian goes through a basic self-leadership module conducted as part of Sec One Orientation. The purpose is for NASians to be familiar with our school values and to exemplify these values in their daily life.&nbsp;

Students can take up formal leadership positions in the following areas:&nbsp;

*   Student Council;
*   CCA;
*   Class Leader;
*   Peer Leader;
*   Sports Leader; and
*   Values In Action (VIA) Leader

Students will receive further leadership training in various platforms, including annual leadership camps and termly trainings with student leadership teachers.

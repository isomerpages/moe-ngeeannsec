### About

The ECG Developmental Model The ECG Developmental Model is a framework that guides schools in programming developmentally appropriate ECG activities for students at different levels. The model highlights education and career development as a process that takes place over one’s life span, with three progressive emphases of Awareness, Exploration and Planning. Awareness, Exploration and Planning are necessary for all levels of students. However, there are different emphases at the different levels to meet varying developmental needs .

<h3>About</h3>
<p>The ECG Developmental Model The ECG Developmental Model is a framework
that guides schools in programming developmentally appropriate ECG activities
for students at different levels. The model highlights education and career
development as a process that takes place over one’s life span, with three
progressive emphases of Awareness, Exploration and Planning. Awareness,
Exploration and Planning are necessary for all levels of students. However,
there are different emphases at the different levels to meet varying developmental
needs .</p>

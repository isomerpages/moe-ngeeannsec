Hello, everyone.

I am Caedmon Tan from 3R5 and I am the 24th President of the Student’s Council. I am very privileged and honoured to be appointed with the responsibility to serve as President. As I take on this role, I am reminded about the countless possibilities – both opportunities and challenges – that lie ahead of all Ngee Ann Students, for us to be the best that we can be. We must believe that we can overcome the challenges and reap the opportunities to achieve better things together for everyone. 

‘I Can &amp; I Care’ is our theme for Student Leaders’ Investiture 2023. In my opinion, it speaks powerfully to the heart of what it means to be a leader. It reaffirms that each of us has the potential to make a positive difference in the world. 

To me, leadership begins with ourselves. Believing in ourselves first, and then caring for others. To begin, we should first seek to be the best version of ourselves. When we strive to be our best, we are in a better position to positively impact those around us. We can definitely make a difference to the community around us, whether through academic excellence, community service, or leadership. We all have the ability to make a difference.  In tandem with believing in our abilities, we must also develop a genuine care for the success and well-being of those around us. As a community, we must always strive to support and encourage one another, to push each other to be the very best versions of ourselves. Let’s exercise High Care and High Expectations for one another!

If you can but you do not care, it is pointless. There is a stark contrast between the mathematical wizard and the innumerate man who imbues kindness and care onto others. It is not always about being the most capable or the most suited in a particular situation to do good. Rather, it will always be about how big a heart you have for others.

The people we remember the most in the future are the ones who have made the greatest impact on our lives. They may not be the best equipped, or the most qualified. But for sure, they are the ones who take the time to reach out and go the extra mile for others. They are the ones who cared.

There is an expression, “Finger in the Dike”, that comes from a popular legend about a young Dutch boy. Most of the Netherlands is below sea level, and many dams were constructed as a preventive measure against flooding. The little boy saw a small stream of water, flowing from a crack in a dam. He knew that if no one stepped forward to stop the leak, the crack would deteriorate over time, and would eventually lead to the collapse of the dam. He then decided to step forward and stopped the leak by using his finger to plug the hole in the wall. 

For me personally, this story clearly illustrates what it means to be a leader. Despite many people walking past that little crack, not a single person stepped forward to address the issue. For various reasons, they thought it beyond them, that someone else would take care of the issue or simply did not care enough to do something about it themselves. Rather, it took a little boy to appreciate the severity of the issue, and to take his initiative to address the matter. In other words, the boy had identified a problem and did what he could to fix it. Leadership is the same. It is about stepping up and doing what you can to make the world a better place. If you see a problem, don’t be afraid to step out of your comfort zone and assist in whatever way you can. See something, do something.

I, alongside my student leaderhip peers, have been entrusted with a weighty responsibility. We have been accorded the responsibility to shape the future of our school, and to make a lasting impact on the lives of our friends. Allow me to share my aspirations for all of us as the student leaders of Ngee Ann Sec, which are really reminders to myself: 

We must remember to lead with integrity, humility and a deep sense of purpose. Be willing to listen and learn from others. Embrace the challenges we will meet and be comfortable with the uncomfortable. Be willing to learn from our mistakes.  Most of all, believe in ourselves and our abilities. Know that we are capable of achieving something of purpose and meaning, and let us make a difference in the lives of those around us. It is not just about what we can do, it is also about how much we care. 

I would like to thank everyone for putting their faith in my team and I. NASians and teachers, thank you for this opportunity. We will carry out our roles to the best of our ability, as we grow, give, guide and glow one another, for our beloved school.

Let us strive to be the best version of ourselves and serve with pride together.

High Care, High Expectations,

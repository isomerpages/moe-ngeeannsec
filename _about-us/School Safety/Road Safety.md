We need to take ownership for creating and maintaining a safe learning environment. While the school remains among the safest place for our students, the occurrence of traffic accident within or in the immediate vicinity of the school is one accident too many. This SOP stipulates the safety measures that are in place and the road safety programmes adopted by the school towards creating and promoting a safe and secure learning environment for all.

The aim of the SOP is to spell out the road safety measures deployed at school. It also includes some road safety rules for students to adhere to.

**General Road Safety**

*   Security staff is deployed at the main gate to facilitate vehicles entering and exiting the school and road crossing of students.
*   All vehicles entering the school are to maintain the speed limit in school, i.e. 15km/hr, which is clearly stated on the road signage.

**Traffic Control**

*   Security staff are donned in luminous attire and glove to direct the traffic depending on the traffic situation at the main gate.
*   There are signages displayed prominently to caution drivers to look out for students’ safety.
*   Zebra crossings, convex mirrors and road humps were constructed to control the vehicular speed inside the school.
*   The school works with agencies like Traffic Police, Town Council and LTA for traffic control outside of school.
*   During wet weather, the school would allow parents’ vehicles to enter the school. Parents can alight their child at the porch outside General Office.

**Road Safety Rules**

**A.   Walking**

*   Cross only at traffic junctions or pedestrian crossing.

o    Refrain from using hand phones or other audio devices when crossing the roads.

o    STOP, look right, look left, and then look right again.

**C.   Cycling**

*   When using a public road, all bicycle riders must obey the same rules as other vehicles. A cyclist may be punished under the Penal Code/ Road Traffic Act should he/she act rashly or negligently so as to endanger human life or the personal safety of others.
*   Always wear protective gear such as a properly secured helmet, shoes (with laces properly tied), elbow and knee pads to protect against injuries.
*   Always make sure that the bicycle is in good working condition, e.g. working brakes, tyres, lights (front and rear), bell, are working, chains are secure, etc.

*   Use separate chopping boards and crockery when preparing raw and cooked food to prevent cross contamination.
*   Students should not taste raw / undercooked food, cooked food should be covered and thawed food must not be re-frozen for use to prevent possible food poisoning.  
      
    

13. Food science experiments and using personal protective equipment:  
  

*   Toxic chemicals should not be used when conducting food science experiments.
*   Potentially dangerous experiments must not be conducted, e.g. testing the smoking points of fats. Safety goggles should be worn when conducting potentially dangerous food science experiments (e.g. addition of mild acids to observe protein denaturation).

**Safety in Art Rooms**

1.  Teachers must ensure that safety precautions are factored in the planning of art lessons/activities in the art room. If the art lessons/activities are conducted by external instructors, teachers are to ensure that the instructors comply with safety measures.  
      
    
2.  A briefing on possible risks and safety precautions in the art room must be conducted during the first lesson/activity of the year. Reminders on safety precautions are to be carried out in subsequent lessons/activities. Separate briefings are to be conducted for students who are absent for the initial briefing.  
      
    
3.  Tools/equipment in the art room must only be used under close supervision of the teacher. Students must be briefed on the proper use of tools/equipment. At no point should a student be given access to sharp-pointed/sharp-edged tools/equipment unless issued and supervised by teacher during art lessons. All issued tools/equipment should be collected and accounted for after use. Students should not possess any personal sharp-pointed/sharp-edged tools (e.g. penknife).  
      
    
4.  The following measures must be put in place when conducting lessons involving volatile, hazardous and/or flammable materials:  
    

*   Ensure good ventilation by keeping windows open, particularly when using materials such as cement/clay, varnish/thinners, heated lead and wax;
*   Avoid accumulation of dust from materials such as clay, glaze, plaster, wood and fibre glass. Ensure that tables are wiped and working areas are wet mopped regularly;
*   Ensure students use spray paints, glazes, adhesives, fixatives, etc., in a spray booth, where available. If a spray booth is unavailable, these materials should only be used in well-ventilated space or outdoor areas; and
*   Ensure students use protective gear such as safety glasses, dust or respiratory masks, ear plugs, gloves and aprons when using materials and equipment that may cause toxic fumes, burns, flying chips or corrosion.  
      
    

5. The following measures are to be taken to prevent tripping:  

*   Keep the floor dry and free of clutter at all times;
*   Store tripping hazards such as loose wires, extension cords and strings when not in use;
*   Place electrical equipment close to power outlets;
*   Fasten or tape wires onto surfaces (e.g. table top or floor) with duct tape; and
*   Minimise students’ movement in the art room.  
      
    

6. The following measures are to be taken during lessons/activities involving hot wax (e.g. Batik painting/printing, candle-making):

*   Ensure good ventilation during lessons/activities. Windows must be opened;
*   Ensure students put on protective gear such as respiratory masks, safety glasses and aprons.
*   The use of induction stoves are strongly recommended as they have safety features that reduce the risk of burns.
*   The use of heavy-based stainless steel pots are strongly recommended as they are more stable. Do not use the following:

* Saucepans with long single handles; and
*  Lightweight pots (e.g. aluminium pots).
*   Watch out for signs of overheating, such as fumes and bubbling of hot wax.
*   Ensure that no more than 3 students are sharing an appliance for melting wax at any one time  
      
    

7. To avoid accidents and burn-related injuries caused by tripping, the following regulations must be adhered to:

*   No walking space between power outlets and appliances;
*   Place appliances on stable worktops which are set against the walls where the appliances are plugged into. Where possible, induction stoves should be secured onto indented worktops to prevent them from getting dislodged;
*   Do not fill pots to more than half their capacity to prevent spillage; and
*   Use only aluminium foil to protect worktops. Do not use materials which will burn easily, e.g. newspaper.

**Introduction**    

*   The evacuation procedure is only activated in times of emergency, for example fire. Activation will be in the form of an alarm.   
    
*   Every level in the school has an assigned Evacuation Route (ER) to the Assembly Area.    
    

**Evacuation Routes**         

*   The Evacuation Routes are used to facilitate the movement of the school population from the respective venues to the Assembly Area in a quick and orderly manner.          
    
*   No one is to deviate from the assigned Evacuation Routes unless instructed by the teacher or if that particular route has become hazardous.           
    
*   Students must participate in the evacuation drill seriously and be familiar with the Evacuation Route.   
    

**The Alarm** 

*   The alarm would be any of the following:          
    
*   Continuous ringing of the school bell           
    
*   Announcement through the PA system

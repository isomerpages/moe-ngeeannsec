I am Yi Cong from 3R4 and I am the 23rd President of the Student Council. It is a great honour and privilege to be given the chance to be the voice of the school as the leader of the Student Council.  I would like to thank my fellow NASians for having faith in me.

  

As the President of the Student Council, I oversee the different consortiums that make up the Student Council. Together with my Vice President, Sze Kay, and fellow student councillors, we would ensure that the school provides nurturing and memorable experiences for everyone in the school. We aspire to be the bridge between the school and student body, enhancing the student body with more experiences. As the President, I hope to be able to rightly lead the Student Council, and in doing so, I follow the footsteps of the Presidents before me. 

  

Thus, I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all the outgoing leaders for all your contributions to the school. You have been amazing role models and your leadership has been inspirational, and your time here has been a true gift. I wish you the best of luck as you move forward in your final year in the school.

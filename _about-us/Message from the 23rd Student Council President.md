I am Yi Cong from 3R4 and I am the 23rd President of the Student Council. It is a great honour and privilege to be given the chance to be the voice of the school as the leader of the Student Council.  I would like to thank my fellow NASians for having faith in me.

  

As the President of the Student Council, I oversee the different consortiums that make up the Student Council. Together with my Vice President, Sze Kay, and fellow student councillors, we would ensure that the school provides nurturing and memorable experiences for everyone in the school. We aspire to be the bridge between the school and student body, enhancing the student body with more experiences. As the President, I hope to be able to rightly lead the Student Council, and in doing so, I follow the footsteps of the Presidents before me. 

  

Thus, I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all the outgoing leaders for all your contributions to the school. You have been amazing role models and your leadership has been inspirational, and your time here has been a true gift. I wish you the best of luck as you move forward in your final year in the school.

<h5>How I’ve grown as a leader in Ngee Ann</h5>

Being a leader in Ngee Ann has taught me many skills. The three most important skills I have learnt would be communication, open mindedness and problem solving.

Communication is essential and important ever since I’ve taken up the projects and responsibilities of a president. Communication is the key to allow others to understand what I believe in and to persuade them to achieve a common goal together. Over time, I realised that it is important for communication to be honest, and that even if you do not agree with the ideas of another person, I should not put down the person. 

  

Being open to feedback from peers and teachers has helped me to improve myself.  encouraged me to step out of my comfort zone and learn more things. During projects, I would gather feedback from my peers, not only checking in with them but also clarifying their doubts. After getting their feedback, I get to see and improve my areas of improvement. Thus, being open to feedback has greatly benefited me and is an important skill to me.

  

Lastly, problem solving skills. I can clearly remember when I applied to join the student council, we were tasked to come up with solutions to certain problems in school. We had to put our problem solving skills to the test. Till this day, problem solving is necessary as we handle multiple projects. For me, I apply my problem solving skills in my CCA, English Drama. Whenever a problem arises, for example, when we face difficulties on deciding on how to act out a skit, I will have to step up and engage my CCA members in brainstorming ideas. Then, we would vote to decide the best idea.

<h5>“A leader is one who knows the way, goes the way, and shows the way.” -John C. Maxwell”</h5>

In my term as President, I aspire to be a leader who has a clear sense of where the student council is heading, and to guide others. I hope to be the leader to create and carry out plans, applying my problem solving skills to the best of my ability. Lastly, I hope to be a leader who always encourages others to work hard and achieve their objectives. 

<h5>With power, comes responsibility</h5>

To the incoming leaders, it is important to realise that when we are given titles as student leaders in the school, we have become a person of influence. We have the power to influence our peers, through what we say and what we do. The simple act of encouraging another peer in class can help to build a positive relationship. Peter Parker aka the Spiderman could not have said it better “With great power, comes great responsibility”. Most often, these responsibilities require us to step out of our comfort zone and require us to make certain sacrifices. For example, in planning and executing projects like the Secondary One Orientation Camp (SOOC), Secondary 4 Facilitators had to go back to school during the holidays, investing time and effort to plan an enriching camp for our new Secondary 1 students. Another example is our class leaders who are involved in executing the Teachers’ Day celebrations in class every year. They go through months of planning to ensure that the celebrations run smoothly and teachers and students can enjoy themselves.

Finally, I would like to thank the teachers and fellow peers who believed in us and gave us the opportunity of taking up our roles. Let us all work together to improve the school and ourselves as individuals to achieve much more!

Thank you.<br>
Yi Cong<br>
23rd President of the Student Council

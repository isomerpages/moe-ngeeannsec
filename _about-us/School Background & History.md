<p>Ngee Ann Secondary’s heritage dates back to the 1840s through The Ngee
Ann Kongsi (NAK), the body responsible for her founding as well as her
growth. Through the advice and the financial support provided by the School
Management Committee, the school has made firm and steady progress over
the years.</p>
<p>The Ngee Ann Kongsi was established by the Teochew community during Singapore’s
colonial era. It began as an altruistic clan that cared for the welfare
of the Teochews. Over time, its mission expanded to benefit the wider community
through education. Its dedication to youth development is seen in the founding
of Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Ngee Ann Primary, and Ngee Ann Secondary School.</p>
<p>When Tuan Mong High School along Tank Road closed, the idea to set up
Ngee Ann Secondary was proposed to continue NAK’s support for education.
Of three proposed sites, the current campus was chosen for its good connectivity
to buses and the MRT. This strategic location, along with our Autonomous
school status and niche in Technology, soon attracted students and staff
alike, allowing the school community to grow and flourish.</p>
<p>Ngee Ann Secondary remains deeply grateful for the steadfast support of
The Ngee Ann Kongsi over the years. Today, we honour our heritage by nurturing
the same spirit of service and contribution. Through our programmes and
school life, every NASian learns to give back to the community. With the
support of the Ministry of Education, the School Management Committee and
our dedicated Ngee Ann staff, the school will continue to forge ahead,
to provide quality education that positively impacts our NASians and the
community around us.</p>

<p>Ngee Ann Secondary has a rich historical heritage dating back to the 1840s
through The Ngee Ann Kongsi, the body responsible for her founding as well
as her growth. Through the advice and the financial support provided by
the School Management Committee, the school has made firm and steady progress
over the years.</p>
<p>The Ngee Ann Kongsi was established by the Teochew community during Singapore’s
colonial era. It began as an altruistic clan that cared for the welfare
of the Teochews. Over time, its mission expanded to benefit the wider community
through education. Its dedication to youth development is seen in the founding
of Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Ngee Ann Primary, and Ngee Ann Secondary School
— a testament to its belief in nurturing minds and building lives through
education.</p>
<p>When Tuan Mong High School along Tank Road closed, the idea of setting
up Ngee Ann Secondary was born. It was meant to continue The Ngee Ann Kongsi’s
support for education, alongside Ngee Ann Primary in Marine Terrace. Of
three proposed sites, the current campus at Tampines Street 32 was chosen
for its good connectivity to buses and the MRT. This strategic location,
along with our Autonomous school status and niche in Technology, soon attracted
students and staff alike, allowing the school community to grow and flourish.</p>
<p>Ngee Ann Secondary remains deeply grateful for the steadfast support of
The Ngee Ann Kongsi over the years. Their guidance and generosity have
enabled NASians to benefit from a wide range of programmes and facilities
for a more enriching secondary experience.</p>
<p>Today, we honour our heritage by nurturing the same spirit of service
and contribution. Through our programmes and school life, every NASian
learns to give back to the community — keeping our proud legacy alive.
Together with the support of the Ministry of Education, the School Management
Committee, our dedicated Ngee Ann staff and all well-wishers, the school
will continue to forge ahead, to provide quality education that positively
impacts our NASians and the community around us.</p>

<p>A very warm welcome to Ngee Ann Secondary School.</p>
<p>I am honoured and excited to lead our school in continuing the incredible
journey we have embarked on. The school was established by the Ngee Ann
Kongsi in 1994 and embodies the giving spirit of our founders, who sought
to contribute towards improving the lives of Singaporeans through education.
This is a core part of our<strong> </strong>Ngee Ann DNA as we seek to
develop our students into <strong>Future-ready Learners and Forward-looking Leaders </strong>who
positively impact those around them.</p>
<p>As I take the baton from my predecessor, I am both deeply thankful and
inspired by the rich history of our school and the firm foundations laid.
Ngee Ann Secondary School has stood out as an Autonomous School, MOE East
Zone Centre of Excellence for ICT and an MOE Future School. Despite our
short history, the school is proud of its progress in innovation in teaching
and learning with the use of educational technology since the early 2000s.
We continue to leverage this strength today. Our teachers experiment with
various tools and pedagogies to make teaching more effective and engaging,
tapping on Artificial Intelligence tools to support learning in the classroom.
The school also focuses on developing students’ digital and media literacies
through our curriculum. This longstanding emphasis on leveraging technology
for learning has become increasingly important in our digitally-connected
and -enhanced world and directly feeds towards our school’s desired outcomes
in developing students to be future-ready, and forward-looking, learners
and leaders of tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>A School of Possibilities and A Home to Grow in</strong>
</p>
<p>To acquire the student outcomes articulated above, Ngee Ann Secondary
positions itself as “A School of Possibilities and A Home to Grow in”. <strong>A School of Possibilities</strong> is
one that goes beyond academic excellence to help students discover and
nurture their strengths, passions and talents in various fields.</p>
<p>At Ngee Ann Secondary, we offer a diverse range of developmental and talent
programs, from SPARKS for Math and Science, to CHAMPS for Humanities and
English Language; from Enhanced Art Programme for budding artists, to the
Technopreneur programme for those keen on coding and entrepreneurship.
The latest addition to our offering is the Sentinel programme, launched
in partnership with the Ministry of Defence, and serves to nurture our
students with passion and know-how in cybersecurity, an emerging area with
much potential.</p>
<p>All our students receive the opportunity to pick up new skills through
thoughtfully curated electives yearly. Authentic learning experiences are
also carefully designed to help students apply and bring concepts to life
in real-world settings.</p>
<p>Through all these experiences, we aim to deepen our students' awareness
of their own strengths and interests, broaden definitions of success and
inspire them towards future goals in life.</p>
<p>To develop Future-Ready Learners, we also place a significant emphasis
on values, dispositions, and mindsets. We complement the MOE Character
and Citizenship Education curriculum by instilling the<strong> Growth Mindset and Gratitude</strong> in
our students through our WOW Wednesday sessions, teachable moments, school
experiences and in-class discussions. Armed with these qualities, our students
will be better prepared to navigate the challenges of a fast-changing,
VUCAH (volatile, uncertain, complex, ambiguous and hyper-connected) world.</p>
<p>We are not just a school; we are a community that believes in creating
forward-looking leaders. Our students are encouraged to care, serve, and
lead in their individual spheres of influence. This forms the foundation
of <strong>our School Culture of High Care and High Expectations</strong>.
In our nurturing environment, both staff and students support one another,
challenging themselves to grow and strive for excellence. It is through
this that we have created Ngee Ann Secondary to be<strong> A Home to Grow in.</strong>
</p>
<p>To this end, we are happy to share that our educators have been recognised
by the Ministry of Education and other agencies for their dedication and
care for our NASians, including being conferred the President’s Award for
Teachers 2023, MOE Outstanding Computing Teacher Award 2023 and the LEAP
Award 2023, amongst other awards and accolades. Our colleagues remain steadfast
and committed to doing our best for our NASians every day.</p>
<p>We are also heartened to see that our 2023 graduating cohort has thrived
under the school’s culture, and outdone both themselves and their seniors
in the GCE examinations despite having to navigate changes during the Covid
pandemic. Like earlier cohorts of NASians, they are well-positioned to
pursue their desired post-secondary aspirations and work towards their
dreams. We wish them the very best in their endeavours ahead!</p>
<p><strong>Soaring to Greater Heights</strong>
</p>
<p>I am honoured and excited to take the school forward on its trajectory
to soar to greater heights. The school is well-positioned to embark on
the Educational Technology Masterplan 2030 and move towards infusing the
21st century competencies into the total curriculum. We will continue to
push on in developing every NASian into a Future-Ready Learner and Forward-Looking
Leader, who not only possesses strong academic knowledge, and also dispositions
and competencies that would enable him/her to lead others to succeed and
give back in a fast-moving, VUCAH world.</p>
<p>To all our prospective students, my colleagues and I are ready to take
you on a memorable and enriching educational adventure. Are you looking
for a secondary education that provides you with a holistic learning experience?
Or are you looking to discover your purpose and direction, making lifelong
friends and cherished memories along the way? Perhaps you aspire to develop
your unique strengths and interests, and use them to serve others? Or do
you simply desire to be ready for whatever the future holds for you? If
this is what you are looking for, we invite you to explore who we are and
what we offer, and whether we are the right fit for you. Together, I am
confident we will soar to greater heights, in a School of Possibilities
and a Home for you to Grow in.</p>
<p>Wishing you a fulfilling and meaningful 2024 ahead!</p>

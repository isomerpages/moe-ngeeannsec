<h4><strong>Principal’s Message 2025</strong></h4>
<p>A warm welcome to Ngee Ann Secondary School. Thank you for taking the
time to find out what makes Ngee Ann Secondary, or NAS, a truly special
place to learn and grow.</p>
<p>At NAS, we are proud of our rich heritage and strong foundations. As an <strong>Autonomous School</strong>,
an <strong>MOE East Zone Centre of Excellence for ICT</strong>, and an<strong> MOE Future School</strong>,
we are committed to innovation in education — to provide enriched, meaningful
learning experiences that prepare our students not just for their formative
years, but for life.</p>
<p>Our roots trace back to our founding by The Ngee Ann Kongsi, an organisation
known for its deep commitment to education and the community. This spirit
of contribution is embedded in our school’s DNA, and lives on in our mission
today: to nurture <strong>future-ready NASians who are Value Creators of the Community</strong>.</p>
<p>We believe that every NASian has the potential to make a difference. This
is why our <strong>Total Curriculum</strong> is thoughtfully designed to
equip students with <strong>21st Century Competencies</strong> to thrive
in a complex world. Beyond the classroom, our <strong>Skills Discovery Electives</strong> and <strong>NAS EdVentures</strong> help
our students to uncover their interests, discover new passions, and apply
their learning in authentic, real-world contexts.</p>
<p>Technology is a powerful enabler in this journey. Our students don’t just
learn <em>about</em> technology — they learn <em>with</em> it and <em>create</em> using
it. Our curriculum is infused with <strong>digital literacy, AI, and design-based learning</strong>.
Through <strong>Interdisciplinary Project Work</strong>, our students are
empowered to use <strong>coding and Design Thinking</strong> to solve real-world
problems with confidence. Those with deeper interests take them further
through <strong>CCAs like robotics, special electives, and</strong>  <strong>talent development programmes</strong> in
technology and cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Just as importantly, we focus on growing the <strong>character and mindset</strong> of
each NASian. From school camps to cohort bonding and learning journeys
local and overseas, our students forge lasting friendships, grow in resilience,
and develop a <strong>Growth and Abundance mindset</strong> — where they
appreciate that intelligence and abilities are not fixed, and that perseverance,
effort and reflection unlock new possibilities.</p>
<p>Today, NAS continues to be recognised for our strengths in teaching and
learning. We are proud to be selected as an MOE external centre for Higher
Chinese, and from 2025, for O-Level Computing as well. NASians with aptitude
are stretched through our <strong>Talent Development Programmes</strong> in
the <strong>Sciences, Humanities, Technology,</strong>  <strong>Cybersecurity and MOE’s Enhanced Art Programme. </strong>These
are made possible through our strong partnerships with community, industry,
schools and organisations, where our students participate in programmes
by Apple and IMDA, Singapore University of Technology and Design and MINDEF’s
Sentinel programme, among others.</p>
<p>Our dedicated educators, who bring passion, expertise, and heart to their
work each day, is what contributes to <strong>Our School Culture of Care and Grow</strong>.
We are proud that their excellence has been recognised through national
accolades such as the President’s Award for Teachers, MOE Caring Teacher
Awards, Outstanding Computing Teacher Award and others. <strong>We believe that every NASian will thrive under this culture</strong>,<strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong>we
are committed to building strong teacher-student and peer relationships
— nurtured daily through learning, play, and shared experiences. At NAS,
we grow not just minds, but hearts — shaping individuals who will step
forward to lead, serve, and make a positive impact wherever they go.</p>
<p>If you believe Ngee Ann Secondary is the right fit for you or your child,
we warmly invite you to get to know us better. Join our vibrant NAS community
— where you or your child will find a place to grow, shine, and become
a Value Creator for self and others.</p>
<p><strong>Come Experience NAS with Us — where We Create Value, We Care and We Grow.</strong>

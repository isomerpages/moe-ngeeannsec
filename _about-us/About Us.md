Ngee Ann Secondary, an Autonomous Government-aided School, was founded in 1994 by Ngee Ann Kongsi. Till today, it remains as the school with the shortest history to attain the Autonomous Schools status and remains the pride of the community as a choice school for students in the east and northeastern regions of the island. In 2007, Ngee Ann Secondary became the East Zone Centre of Excellence for ICT and since then, it has continued to lead the way and join other elite schools, locally and internationally, to use new technologies to transform and impact teaching and learning innovatively. In 2011, Ngee Ann Secondary attained the status of one of MOE’s 8 FutureSchools@Singapore. This is one of the highest levels of recognition for schools which have successfully incorporated technology into teaching and learning. Besides being a beacon of excellence in harnessing new emerging technologies, Ngee Ann Secondary is also one of the few schools to be accredited as a Centre of the Enhanced Art Programme.

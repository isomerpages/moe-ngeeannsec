history to attain the Autonomous School status. Our distinguished history
includes serving as MOE's East Zone Centre of Excellence in ICT from 2007-2021,
and we are one of the Future Schools looking into innovative ways of learning
with technology.</p>

the Pride of the Community." Every day, we bring this vision to life through
our mission of "Teaching, Touching and Transforming Lives," creating an
energetic and nurturing environment where students flourish and discover
their unique potential. We believe in preparing you for the future, so
that all of you, our NASians, go on to become Value Creators of the Community.</p>

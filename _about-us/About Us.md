**Welcome to Ngee Ann Secondary School - Your Home to Grow In!**

Established in 1994 by The Ngee Ann Kongsi, we are a vibrant, exciting school that stands as one of the choice secondary schools in the East.

To date, Ngee Ann Secondary (NAS) remains as the school with the shortest history to attain the Autonomous School status. Our distinguished history includes serving as MOE's East Zone Centre of Excellence in ICT from 2007-2021, and we are one of the Future Schools looking into innovative ways of learning with technology.

Our community is guided by our vision to be "An Icon of Excellence and the Pride of the Community." Every day, we bring this vision to life through our mission of "Teaching, Touching and Transforming Lives," creating an energetic and nurturing environment where students flourish and discover their unique potential. We believe in preparing you for the future, so that all of you, our NASians, go on to become Value Creators of the Community.

Our unique offerings – such as being one of nine **Enhanced Art Programme schools** in Singapore, and our partnerships with agencies and Institutes of Higher Learning open new worlds of learning and inspiration for NASians.

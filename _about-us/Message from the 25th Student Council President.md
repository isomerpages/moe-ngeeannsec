<p>Hello, everyone.</p>
<p>I am Toh Xin Junn from 3RY, and I am truly honoured to serve as the President
of the 26th Student Council at Ngee Ann Secondary School. This role represents
not just a position of leadership, but an opportunity to give back to the
institution that has profoundly shaped my character and values. Being entrusted
with this role is both meaningful and exciting, and I am grateful for the
opportunity to give back to the school that has shaped so much of who I
am.</p>
<p>To me, leadership goes beyond holding an appointment - it lies in how
we support, empower, and uplift those around us. This aligns strongly with
the theme for 2025 Student Leaders Investiture "Serve. Lead. Inspire.",
which encapsulates the essence of purposeful leadership. This theme reminds
us that leadership starts with service, grows through action, and lives
on through the people we inspire. As the President, I hope to bring this
theme to life by serving with a heart, leading by example and inspiring
others to step up with confidence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Student Council is not just a leadership body - it is the heartbeat
of our student community that orchestrates the rhythm of our school. Student
Council keeps the school spirit alive, brings people together and supports
the key moments that shape our experience in Ngee Ann.</p>
<p>My vision for the 26th Student Council is for us to lead in a way that
inspires those around us. I hope for us to be a team that is unafraid to
try new things, genuinely seeks to uplift others and remains grounded by
actively listening to those we serve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether we’re organising a major event or just checking in on a classmate,
I believe that every action counts, as even the smallest gestures can leave
the most lasting impact.</p>
<p>In any leadership journey, there will always be challenges. As Winston
Churchill once said, "Success is not final, failure is not fatal, it is
the courage to continue that counts." Ngee Ann has shown me that true growth
comes when we are able to embrace challenges with determination and resilience.
In my term as the President of the Student Council, I promise to embrace
every adversity with a growth mindset.</p>
<p>Last, but most importantly, I’d like to sincerely thank my teachers and
fellow NASians who stood by me and believed in me. Thank you for entrusting
me with this role and reminding me what it means to lead with a heart.
Alongside my fellow EXCO and councillors, we will continue to serve with
purpose, lead with courage and stay true to the voices of those we represent.</p>

<p>Let us continue this journey together, supporting one another as we build
a Ngee Ann that fills every student with pride and purpose. Through collective
effort and shared vision, we can create an even more vibrant and inclusive
school community.</p>

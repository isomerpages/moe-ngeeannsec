<p>We have organised a series of orientation activities to ease our Secondary
1 students into their new school environment and to help them adapt to
secondary school life.</p>
<p>The Secondary 1 Orientation Programme aims to integrate your child/ward
with the Ngee Ann family and help him/her to establish new friendships
with his/her peers.</p>
<p>All Secondary 1 students will experience a 4-day orientation programme
held on 2 January and 5-7 January 2026. The programme will include class
bonding activities, a school tour, a Ngee Ann Heritage Tour and leadership
skills training.</p>

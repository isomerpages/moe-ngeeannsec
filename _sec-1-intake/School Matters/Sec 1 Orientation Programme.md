We have organised a series of orientation activities to ease our Secondary 1 students into their new school environment and to help them adapt to secondary school life. 
  
The Secondary 1 Orientation Programme, geNASis, aims to integrate your child/ward with the Ngee Ann family and help him/her to establish new friendships with his/her peers. 

All Secondary 1 students will experience the orientation programme in the form of a 3-day, 1-night camp held from 3-5 January 2024. It will include class bonding activities, a school tour, a Ngee Ann Heritage Tour and leadership skills training.

You will receive more detailed information about geNASis during the Secondary 1 Registration Briefing over Zoom on Thursday 21 December 2023. 

To facilitate the planning of the programme, we will extract your child/ward’s dietary needs from your response to our [online registration form](https://form.gov.sg/6554c5d94833110012f97115). 

Information about your child/ward’s medical history will be extracted from his/her Individual Student Details Report on the MOE database.

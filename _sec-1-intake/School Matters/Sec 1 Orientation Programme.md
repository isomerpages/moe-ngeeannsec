<p>We have organised a series of orientation activities to ease our Secondary
1 students into their new school environment and to help them adapt to
secondary school life.</p>
<p>The Secondary 1 Orientation Programme, geNASis, aims to integrate your
child/ward with the Ngee Ann family and help him/her to establish new friendships
with his/her peers.</p>
<p>All Secondary 1 students will experience the orientation programme in
the form of a 2-day camp held from 2-3 January 2025. It will include class
bonding activities, a school tour, a Ngee Ann Heritage Tour and leadership
skills training.</p>

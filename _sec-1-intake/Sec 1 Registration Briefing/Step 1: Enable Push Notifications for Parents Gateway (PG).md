<p>Ngee Ann Secondary School has been using MOE’s <strong>Parents Gateway (PG)</strong> portal
to communicate with our students’ parents/guardians since January 2020.</p>
<p><strong>If you are onboard PG</strong> and have been receiving notifications
sent by your child/ward’s primary school, you do not need to do anything.
MOE will port your PG account over to our school’s database on Friday,
19 December 2025. We will start sending PG notifications to you after we
have access to your PG account.</p>
<p><strong>If you have not registered for a PG account</strong>, please visit
<a href="https://pg.moe.edu.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://pg.moe.edu.sg/</a>to learn more about the portal and its features.
You can also visit <a href="https://pg.moe.edu.sg/faq" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://pg.moe.edu.sg/faq</a> to learn
how to download the app to your smartphone. Please note that you will need
your <strong>SingPass to register for a PG account</strong>. The PG app
only supports the following operating systems – Android 6.0 or later and
iOS 11.0 or later.</p>
<p>When you have downloaded the app and registered your account, please <strong><u>enable the app to push notifications to your smartphone automatically</u></strong> so
you can access new messages in a timely manner.</p>
<p><strong>Please note that the school will need up to 3 working days to access newly-registered PG accounts.</strong>

Ngee Ann Secondary School has been using MOE’s **Parents Gateway (PG)** portal to communicate with our students’ parents/guardians since January 2020.

**If you are onboard PG** and have been receiving notifications sent by your child/ward’s primary school, you do not need to do anything. MOE will port your PG account over to our school’s database on Wednesday 18 December 2024. We will start sending PG notifications to you after we have access to your PG account.

**If you have not registered for a PG account**, please visit [https://pg.moe.edu.sg/](https://pg.moe.edu.sg/) to learn more about the portal and its features. You can also visit [https://pg.moe.edu.sg/faq](https://pg.moe.edu.sg/faq) to learn how to download the app to your smartphone. Please note that you will need your **SingPass to register for a PG account**. The PG app only supports the following operating systems – Android 6.0 or later and iOS 11.0 or later.

When you have downloaded the app and registered your account, please <u><b>enable the app to push notifications to your smartphone automatically<b></b></b></u> so you can access new messages in a timely manner.

<b><b>Please note that the school will need up to **3 working days to access newly-registered PG accounts**.</b></b>

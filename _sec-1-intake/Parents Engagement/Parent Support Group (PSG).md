<p>Ngee Ann Secondary has a very active Parent Support Group (PSG) whose
members work closely with the school to engage parents for the well-being
of their children.</p>
<p>The school would like to encourage all parents to join the PSG, as it
is a platform for parents to network, support one another and share experiences
as their children enter into a new and exciting phase of their life.</p>
<p>As members of the PSG, parents will be kept up-to-date on the latest school
developments and activities through emails to the PSG and at PSG meetings.
In addition, the PSG works hand-in-hand with the school to provide parents
with opportunities to participate in school activities and to bond with
their children.</p>
<p>The PSG has planned a face-to-face session to warmly welcome parents of
Sec 1 students to the PSG family. <a href="/files/Annex_B_Invitation_Letter_NAS_PSG_FOR_20265__LBC_.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Click here to download Annex B </a>to

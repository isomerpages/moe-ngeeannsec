Ngee Ann Secondary has a very active Parent Support Group (PSG) whose members work closely with the school to engage parents for the well-being of their children. 

The school would like to encourage all parents to join the PSG, as it is a platform for parents to network, support one another and share experiences as their children enter into a new and exciting phase of their life. 

As members of the PSG, parents will be kept up-to-date on the latest school developments and activities through emails to the PSG and at PSG meetings. In addition, the PSG works hand-in-hand with the school to provide parents with opportunities to participate in school activities and to bond with their children. 

The PSG has planned a face-to-face session to warmly welcome parents of Sec 1 students to the PSG family. *[Click here to download Annex E](/files/Sec%201%20Intake%202025/Annex_E_Invitation_Letter_NAS_PSG_2025.pdf)* to learn more about this session.

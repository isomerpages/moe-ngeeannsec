<h2><strong>Think it Through</strong></h2>
<p>How do you know if Ngee Ann Secondary’s DSA suits you? The following considerations
might help:</p>
<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>The Ngee Ann DNA</u>.
Check out what Ngee Ann stands for from the information on our school website.
Do the flagship programmes and the Ngee Ann Experience excite you? Is it
aligned to what you look for in your secondary education?</p>
<p>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Learning culture and rigour</u>.
What sort of learner are you? Do you learn well with technology? Do you
want breadth with depth? Can you handle independence with discipline? Do
you take ownership of your own learning? Can you learn in groups? Decide
if our pace and pitching is right for you.</p>
<p>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Your strength, interest and talent area</u>.
Can our DSA programmes meet your needs? Can we take you further? How can
you use your strength, interest and talent to enrich, build and serve the
Ngee Ann Sec community?</p>
<p>Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on
the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic
and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop
the area of talent.</p>

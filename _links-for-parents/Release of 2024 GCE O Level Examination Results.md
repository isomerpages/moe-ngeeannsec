<h2><strong>Information on Results Collection</strong></h2>
<p>Dear NASians and Parents/Guardians of the 2024 Graduating Cohort,</p>
<p>MOE and SEAB have recently announced that the GCE O-Level Examination
results will be released on&nbsp;<strong>Friday, 10 January 2025 at 2.30 pm</strong>.</p>
<p>School candidates are reminded to be properly groomed and dressed in their
school attire. School candidates can report to the Multi-Purpose Hall (MPH)
at 2pm and parents/guardians are welcome to accompany their child/ward.
Due to the seating capacity, we will be appreciative if there is no more
than 2 guests ( parents/ guardians/caregivers) per student.</p>
<p>School candidates who are unwell should not return to school to collect
the results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>School candidates who are unable to collect their results in person should
inform the school before 10 January 2025 through your Form Teacher, and
can appoint a proxy to collect a physical copy of their results on their
behalf. Proxies can proceed to the General Office to collect the results.&nbsp;
Proxies are required to produce the relevant documents (Photo ID for identification
&amp; Letter of Authorisation) for the school’s verification when collecting
the results. School candidates may contact the school through your Form
Teacher for assistance if candidates are unable to appoint a proxy.</p>

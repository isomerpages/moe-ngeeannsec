Do you have a strength, interest or talent area we are looking for? 
Do you think that Ngee Ann Secondary School will be a good fit for you? 

The Ngee Ann Secondary School Direct School Admission (DSA-Sec) to Secondary One in 2024 is open to interested applicants. 

Application for DSA-Sec can be submitted through the online DSA-Sec Portal. The application is free-of-charge and will be open from **4 May 2023, 11am - 31 May 2023, 3pm**. For more details, please refer to MOE website –
[MOE website](http://www.moe.gov.sg/dsa-sec.)

### Think it Through

How do you know if Ngee Ann Secondary’s DSA suits you? The following considerations might help:

(i)	The Ngee Ann DNA. Check out what Ngee Ann stands for from the information on our school website. Do the flagship programmes and the Ngee Ann Experience excite you? Is it aligned to what you look for in your secondary education?

(ii)	Learning culture and rigour. What sort of learner are you? Do you learn well with technology? Do you want breadth with depth? Can you handle independence with discipline? Do you take ownership of your own learning? Can you learn in groups? Decide if our pace and pitching is right for you.

(iii)	Your strength, interest and talent area. Can our DSA programmes meet your needs? Can we take you further? How can you use your strength, interest and talent to enrich, build and serve the Ngee Ann Sec community?  

Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.

Students who are successfully admitted to Ngee Ann Secondary via DSA are expected to honour their commitment to the school and participate in the activities related to the talent they are selected in, for the duration of the programme admitted to. For DSA talent areas associated with a CCA, they are also expected to remain in their CCA. If your child is not able to fulfil the DSA commitment without valid reasons, they may be required to transfer out to another school.

### DSA-Sec Talent Shortlisting Criteria

The selection criteria and process for the talent areas will be updated from early-May. For more information on DSA-Sec, please refer to the MOE website at https://www.moe.gov.sg/dsa-sec.

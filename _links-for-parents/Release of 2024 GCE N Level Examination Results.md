results will be released on&nbsp;<strong>Monday, 16 December 2024 at 2 pm</strong>.</p>
<p>School candidates are reminded to be properly groomed and dressed in their
school attire. School candidates can report to the Auditorium from 1.30
pm onwards and parents/guardians are welcome to accompany their child/ward.</p>
<p>School candidates who are unable to collect their results in person should

a proxy to collect a physical copy of their results on their behalf. Proxies
can proceed to the General Office to collect the results.&nbsp; Proxies
are required to produce the relevant documents (Photo ID for identification

<h3><strong>FAQ</strong></h3>
<p><strong>How do I replace a missing accessory?</strong>
<br>Parents can buy replacement accessories from Apple, AsiaPac or other retail
shops.</p>
<p><strong>Can students still send their devices to their AsiaPac’s service centres for repairs after the end of the warranty period and how will the charges be imposed?</strong>
<br>After the expiry of the device warranty period, students can still send
their device to the service centre for repair. The charges quotation will
be provided by the service centre and students/parents will have to decide
whether to take up the repair based on the quotation received. Alternatively,
students can consider going to alternative service centres (e.g. shops)
to perform the repairs after the warranty is over.</p>
<p><strong>How long do I need to keep the device’s original packaging before discarding it?</strong>
<br>Please keep the device’s original packaging for at least 7 days in case
of defects and proceed to 1-to-1 exchange at the AsiaPac Service Centre.</p>
<p><strong>What is considered as an Accidental damage?</strong>
<br>AppleCare defines accidental damages as damage from handling resulting
from an unexpected and unintentional external event (such as, drops and
damage caused by liquid contact). If it is found that the damages is caused
by accidental damage, a service fee is required. This includes damages
found during repair such as internal water damage.</p>
<p><strong>My Apple pencil isn’t working, how do I check if it is faulty?</strong>
<br>Examine your iPad settings and the apple pencil condition:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>If the Apple pencil is not able to write but can still be connected and
charged, change the nib of the pencil with the spare nib that is given
in the apple box.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the Apple pencil is not able to charge or be detected on iPad the iPad,
use the adapter given in the Apple box and connect it to the pencil and
the iPad charger for 1-2mins. If it retains the charge, proceed to use
as usual. However, if it remains undetectable, the device is considered
faulty.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>*Note: Even though this is an internal issue, any physical damages found
on the pencil may be considered by the technicians as being caused by an
accidental damage.</p>

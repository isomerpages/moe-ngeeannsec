<p>In the event of school closure, Ngee Ann Secondary School (NAS) will operate
digitally as e-NAS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>e-NAS will be the one-stop digital space for all instructions and learning
materials related to Home-Based Learning (HBL). For security purposes,
we have communicated with the students and with you separately on how to
access e-NAS.</p>
<h3>Online Platforms for Learning</h3>
<p>Students will be using a variety of online platforms and resources for
Home-Based Learning (HBL) in the event of school closure. These include
the Student Learning Space (SLS) and Google Classroom.</p>
<p>Should students face any difficulties in accessing the SLS or other platforms,
they should first attempt to reset the password to their school registered
email, failing which they should follow the steps below:</p>

In the event of school closure, Ngee Ann Secondary School (NAS) will operate digitally as e-NAS. 

e-NAS will be the one-stop digital space for all instructions and learning materials related to Home-Based Learning (HBL). For security purposes, we have communicated with the students and with you separately on how to access e-NAS.

### Online Platforms for Learning

Students will be using a variety of online platforms and resources for Home-Based Learning (HBL) in the event of school closure. These include the Student Learning Space (SLS) and Google Classroom.

Should students face any difficulties in accessing the SLS or other platforms, they should first attempt to reset the password to their school registered email, failing which they should follow the steps below:

1.  Students can contact the **School-based Helpline** for queries including access matters such as password reset and unlocking of accounts, as well as queries about lesson assignments.   
      
    
2. **Request for a password reset via**  [**http://go.gov.sg/naspwdreset**](http://go.gov.sg/naspwdreset)   or

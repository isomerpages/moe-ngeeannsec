### Information on Results Collection

Dear NASians and Parents/Guardians of the 2022 Graduating Cohort, MOE and SEAB have recently announced that the GCE N-Level Examination results will be released on **Monday, 19 December 2022 at 2 pm**. 

School candidates are reminded to be properly groomed and dressed in their school attire. School candidates can report to the Auditorium from 1.30 pm onwards and parents/guardians are welcome to accompany their child/ward.

School candidates who are unwell or are required to self-isolate due to a positive COVID-19 test result should not return to school to collect the results. 

#### **Online access to results:**

In addition, all students will be able to view their results for the 2022 national examinations online, via SEAB’s results release system on the day of the national examination’s results release.

School candidates who are eligible for Singpass can use their Singpass account to access SEAB’s Candidates Portal. School candidates who are International Students will receive the system-generated username via email from 14 December 2022. SEAB’s Candidates Portal will be accessible from 19 December 2022 to 30 December 2022. 

School candidates who are unable to collect their results in person should inform the school before 19 Dec through your Form Teacher, and can appoint a proxy to collect a physical copy of their results on their behalf. Proxies can proceed to the General Office to collect the results.  Proxies are required to produce the relevant documents (Photo ID for identification & Letter of Authorisation) for the school’s verification when collecting the results. School candidates may contact the school through your Form Teacher for assistance if candidates are unable to appoint a proxy, or if candidates have not received their system-generated username for SEAB’s Candidates Portal. Please do so before 19 Dec.

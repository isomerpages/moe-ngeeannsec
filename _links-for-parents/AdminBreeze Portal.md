### Use of AdminBreeze Portal

1. Besides the use of Parents Gateway for keeping you updated, the school utilises an online portal, AdminBreeze, to share more information with you about your child/ward. Please click [here](https://ngeeann.adminbreeze.com/) to access AdminBreeze.

  
2. The table below illustrates the functions in which we will utilise the two common platforms for parental engagement:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Parents Gateway</th>
    <th>AdminBreeze</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>General announcements</td>
    <td>Parental access of customised information (e.g. Academic progress of your child/ward)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Consent forms</td>
    <td>Broadcasting information accessible for both parents and students</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> </td>
    <td>Other administrative functions (e.g. scheduling Meet the Parents sessions)</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

3. The default login username and password are as follows:

Username: NRIC (not case-sensitive) <br>
Password NRIC (in small letters)

For example, <br>
Username: S7523947A <br>
Password: s7523947a

  

4. If you are facing difficulties with accessing the platform, you may email the school ICT helpdesk at nass_helpme_ict@moe.edu.sg for technical assistance.

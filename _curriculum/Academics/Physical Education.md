### Fitness helps students think better, feel better, move better!


##### **PHYSICAL EDUCATION**

**Diagram 1**: PE goals are cascaded into the PE curriculum, which in turn determines the pedagogical practices to aid teaching as well as the different assessment methods for learning, thereby ensuring instructional alignment.

  

Physical education (PE) is an important instructional programme that provides broad-based development of physical competencies so that all students are able to pursue physical and sporting activities at their own physical and interest level, well into their adulthood.

  

##### OUR APPROACH

<img src="/images/PE2%2015022022.jpg" 
     style="width:75%">
		 
**Diagram 2**: Goals of PE are shaped by (a) our school’s mission, vision and values, (b) MOE’s framework for 21st century competencies and student outcomes, (c) the national (Health Promotion Board) guidelines for physical activities, as well as (d) MOE’s PE and sports development framework.

We celebrate individual differences! We understand that not everyone likes physical activities but we strive to change that. We aim to impact all students such that they acknowledge being physically active is important, but they may not be ready yet to embark on a lifelong physically active journey. All our students should also be able to understand how a sport is being played, as well as appreciate when good skill execution or tactical play is being demonstrated.

After going through our PE programme, most students should have been exposed to a wide variety of sports so that they can participate in sports at the recreation level as well as keeping an active lifestyle, when they are ready! Those with the interest and ability will be able to pursue and compete at a higher level.


##### OUR CURRICULUM

<img src="/images/PE3%2015022022.jpg" 
     style="width:75%">
		 
**Diagram 3**: The PE curriculum comprised of varied PE modules and are augmented by different seasonal programmes.

  

The physical ability and interest of each person change across the life span. With a broad range of physical competencies and exposure to different sports, we hope that each student is enabled at any level of participation from which to choose from and switch to the physical activities and sports they prefer. Students will be enabled to continue their participation recreationally or competitively, thus motivating them towards lifelong participation.

  

The PE lessons remain the anchor and centrepiece of the programme. The sports and physical activities chosen are unique across the different years, and with sports belonging to the three different categories under the Teaching Games for Understanding teaching model. This wide spread of choices was afforded in the hope that some of the games sufficiently interest the students to participate long into adulthood, as part of adopting physically active lifestyle.

  

Four seasonal events augment the PE programme.

  

(a) Our Outdoor Education is weaved into our cohort level camps. These camps provide the authentic learning experiences for problem-solving and decision-making, both individually and in groups. Students experience real consequences of their actions and decisions that affect themselves and the people around them. They also develop an array of outdoor knowledge and skills that enable them to enjoy the camping experiences with their peers. It is hoped that these experiences seed an attitude in students to be comfortable and safe in the outdoors. 

  

(b) The sports season is held at the end of each PE module for students to apply what they have learnt. Using the Sport Education model, students adopt the roles of players, coaches, referees and statisticians to deepen their knowledge of the sport learnt. Another iteration of the sports season appears in the form of post-exam activities where the students compete in inter-class games of the sports they have learnt for the year.

  

(c) The aNASing Race is our annual cross-country race. Over their four years with us, we bring students to different curated, iconic running trails and venues in the eastern/southern part of Singapore to share with them the joy of competing and completing a challenging event. This aims to build perseverance and to instill a “can-do” attitude in them while helping them to appreciate Singapore’s development through the cityscapes they enjoy their run in.

  

(d) The NAS-Edventure is a platform for students to apply and combine the knowledge and skills learnt in PE lessons with another discipline to solve issues encountered in real life. This problem-based learning approach aims to develop students to think critically as well as to experience opportunities for inter-disciplinary work. 

  

##### OUR PEDAGOGY

<img src="/images/PE4%2015022022.jpg" 
     style="width:75%">

**Diagram 4**: Teaching Games for Understanding is the main teaching model, but elements of other teaching models are also utilized so as to maximise teaching effectiveness.

  

Our PE teachers practise differentiated instruction. They strive to deliver PE lessons in a variety of ways so as to vary the challenge level for the students, to keep the classes exciting, to cater to the different readiness of the students, as well as to deliver the different learning outcomes. 

  

In a typical lesson, the Teaching Games for Understanding (TGfU) is the main teaching model used. The students begin by playing a modified or small-sided version of the game designed to highlight the technical, conceptual or tactical challenge associated with the game. Then the students go through a skill or tactical practice to explore resolutions to the challenge highlighted in the earlier game. The lesson is closed with another game so that students apply the resolutions to the challenge identified, hopefully demonstrating improved skill or tactical execution. This approach has been regarded as more enjoyable than the traditional skill-based PE delivery as students become more competent learners, learning within the context of the game. 

  

Other elements of different teaching models are also utilised. The sport education model allows overt applications of skills and provides authentic role-modelling akin to professional sport teams. Cooperative learning leverages the social aspects of learning, while differentiated instruction caters to the different learning readiness of the students.

  

Relevant lessons are underpinned by e-pedagogy as PE teachers attempt to create new learning possibilities afforded by digital technologies. Effective use of technology accelerates and deepens learning by enabling learning to be more active and personalised. 

##### OUR ASSESSMENT

     style="width:75%">
		 
**Diagram 5**: Our assessment aims to inform about teaching and to impact learning, and leverages our school strength in the use of technology to empower learners and enhance learning.

  

In our school, assessment in PE is a continuous process. Together with e-pedagogy, assessment is used to inform teaching and in turn impact learning through deploying tech. Our students are exposed to and become comfortable with using technology to learn in our lessons.

  

PE teachers provide the success criteria by showing how the professionals do it via video clips and then augment this with live demonstrations. Through real time video recordings, students do not have to recall what they did during practice. They view themselves in action, playing back and reviewing what their peers have recorded of them. Coupled with the teacher-designed tools (Student Peer Observation Tools, SPOT), teachers guide students to conduct self- and peer-assessment to critique and identify their own progress. With the data, teachers can make use of them to plan and adapt subsequent lessons to close teaching and learning gaps.

  

PE teachers also design criterion-referenced assessment (Teacher Observation Tool of Students, TOTS). Students’ performances are judged against established criteria. This can be in the areas of skills acquisition, tactical displays and or social interaction. Such comparison allows all students to potentially achieve the target, eliminating comparison with others and therefore promoting collaborative learning.

  

Compared to the traditional practice, teaching and learning is no longer an exercise of recalling what students can do. Students and teachers alike view objective data, and master the art of deciphering what they see, translating them into information to improve their skills.

  

It is our commitment to strive to develop sound and reliable assessment criteria, through honing sports observational skills, keeping abreast with knowledge of learning activities and skills, while continuing to sharpen our team judgments of students’ execution of exercises and games.

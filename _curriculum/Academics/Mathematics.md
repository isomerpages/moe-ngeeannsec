### Syllabus Objectives


##### Creative Real-World Problem Solvers

The department aims to equip our students with a strong fundamental mathematical knowledge and to nurture them to become creative problem solvers. Besides mathematical conceptual understanding and skills proficiency, development of process skills that are involved in the acquiring and applying mathematical knowledge is also emphasised to the students. These include reasoning, communication and connections, thinking skills and heuristics, as well as application and modelling. Students are given the opportunity to develop mathematical reasoning skills, communicate problem-solving methods and apply learnt concepts through real-world context problems and authentic mathematical modelling tasks.

##### Subjects Offered

*   Mathematics&nbsp;
*   Additional Mathematics&nbsp;
*   Principles of Accounts
*   Computing&nbsp;
*   Elements of Business Skills
*   Computer Applications

##### Mathematics &amp; Additional Mathematics

The syllabus aims to provide students with the fundamental mathematical knowledge and skills. For Elementary Mathematics, the content is organised into three strands namely, Number and Algebra, Geometry and Measurement, and Statistics and Probability.&nbsp; For Additional Mathematics, the content includes topics such as Algebra, Geometry and Trigonometry and Calculus.

The Mathematics syllabus aims to enable all students to:

- acquire mathematical concepts and skills for continuous learning in mathematics and to support learning in other subjects

- develop thinking, reasoning, communication, application and metacognitive skills through a mathematical approach to problem-solving

- connect ideas within mathematics and between mathematics and other subjects through applications of mathematics

- build confidence and foster interest in mathematics.&nbsp;

- connect ideas within mathematics and between mathematics and the sciences through applications of mathematics

- appreciate the abstract nature and power of mathematics.&nbsp;

##### Principles of Accounts

The syllabus aims to help students to develop the abilities to prepare, communicate and use accounting information.

- As preparers of accounting information, students are to develop&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp;• an understanding of the elements, theories and procedures of accounting;

&nbsp; &nbsp;• an understanding of the accounting information system;

&nbsp; &nbsp;• the skills of recording, organising, summarising and analysing business transactions;

- As communicators of accounting information, students are to develop

&nbsp; &nbsp;• an understanding of how accounting information is being presented;

&nbsp; &nbsp;• the skills of presenting quantitative accounting information;

- As users of accounting information, students are to develop

&nbsp; &nbsp;• an understanding of how accounting information is being used; and

&nbsp; &nbsp;• the skills of analysing, interpreting and evaluating business performance and status.&nbsp;

##### Computing

The syllabus aims to provide students with a foundation in computing so that the skills and concepts learnt can be applicable in other fields requiring computing.

Students will learn to:

- apply logical reasoning and algorithmic thinking in analysing problem situations and developing solutions

- develop simple programs through the use of appropriate programming language(s)

- understand how and where information communications technology (ICT) is used in daily life

- understand and explain the ethical, social and economic issues associated with ICT.

The computer science concepts and skills behind ICT will also be taught where appropriate.

##### Elements of Business Skills

This syllabus aims to develop in students the knowledge, skills and attitudes to be productive employees and contributing members of society.

Students will be able to develop:

- basic understanding of business activities in the travel and tourism, hospitality and retail industries

- basic marketing concepts and customer relations skills

- basic employability skills for working in the travel and tourism, hospitality and retail industries

- analytical and evaluative skills and the ability to make judgments

- self and relationship management, social awareness, and responsible decision-making.&nbsp;


##### Computer Applications

The Computer Applications syllabus aims to help students to

• develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

• acquire skills in using a variety of application software and computer hardware&nbsp;

• develop an awareness of how computing technology is used in the home, school, workplace and community

• appreciate the role computers play in everyday life and recognise the impact computers have on society and people

Besides theoretical knowledge, students are also trained in the use of various softwares to develop their skills in handling documents, spreadsheets and media content.

##### Special Programmes

* Math Olympiad training
* Math Trail
* Temasek Poly InfoDay Visit &amp; e-visit
* Work attachment to companies and polytechnics (Computing)
* Enrichment programmes and learning journeys eg game design, chatbot creation (Computing)

### Syllabus Objectives

**Informed and Critical Thinkers. Concerned and Participative Global Citizens.**&nbsp;

The department encourages our students to be inquisitive about the world they live in. We give them the opportunity to ask questions about various historical, geographical, political, social and economic issues. We bring them through the stages of the inquiry-based approach to learning, where they investigate complex issues by forming questions, gathering evidence from different perspectives and questioning the validity and reliability of these sources of information. By doing so, our students develop the skills, and understand the need, to be informed and critical thinkers. We also challenge them to reflect on the complexity of these issues, establish links to current developments and get them to suggest actions that can be taken to improve on different situations. Through these efforts, we hope to encourage our students to step up and contribute meaningfully to Singapore and the global community they are a part of.

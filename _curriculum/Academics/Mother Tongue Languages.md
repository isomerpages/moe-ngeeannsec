##### Chinese New Year Celebration: Hamper Design Competition and Well Wishes Instagram Competition

Every year, besides the CNY concert celebrated by all, the MTL also organised two competitions to welcome the new year. The first is the CNY Hamper Design Competition where each class will create a hamper based on the required theme. There will be three winners for each level, and all hampers will be donated to the selected elderly centre or children’s home. The objective of this competition is to learn to be grateful for what we have, and also share it with others. The second competition is the Well Wishes Instagram competition where each class will prepare a short video clip based on well wishes for CNY.

### Purpose of Full SBB

With Full SBB, we are moving towards one secondary education, with many subject bands, to better meet our students’ learning needs. This is part of the broader shift in our education system to recognise the strengths and interests of our children, to help them build their confidence and develop an intrinsic motivation to learn for life. By 2024, the roll out of FSBB to all secondary schools will be completed.

    <td class="tg-1niu">Building on the SBB that we already offer to students in English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics and Science, our school will extend SBB to include the Humanities subject.<br> <br>We will provide Secondary 2 students the opportunity to take Humanities subjects at a more demanding level, if they meet subject-specific criteria.<br> <br>This is applicable to students who are in the Secondary 2 Normal (Academic) course from 2022.<br> <br>Eligible students from the 2021 Secondary 1 Normal (Academic) cohorts who are promoted to the same course in 2022 will be able to offer Geography, History or Literature at a more demanding level. With this increased flexibility in customising our students’ learning experiences, we are better able to recognise their strengths and nurture their intrinsic motivation to learn.<br> <br>Students who wish to be considered to offer Geography, History or Literature at a more demanding level will have to meet subject-specific criteria in Secondary 1. They should also possess positive attitude towards learning and strong commitment to offer the subject at a more demanding level, as assessed by the school.<br> </td>

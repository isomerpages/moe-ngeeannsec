#### Syllabus Objectives

##### Critical Thinkers. Passion for Scientific Inquiry.

The department aims to develop students to be passionate about scientific knowledge and to equip students with the skills and competencies required for them to thrive in a fast-changing world. The learning of Science must be meaningful and vibrant. Beyond the acquisition of Scientific knowledge, we desire to inculcate the practices of science as a way of thinking as well as the values and attitudes of scientific practice through our Ngee Ann Science Curriculum.&nbsp;

While our students are diverse with different needs and aptitudes for science, we believe that our students are curious and enjoy learning how everyday phenomena have scientific connections. Hence, our curriculum is grounded in knowledge, issues and questions that&nbsp;relate to the roles played by science in daily life, society and the environment. The end goal is to nurture all students to be scientifically literate and to provide strong science foundation for students to innovate and pursue careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).

*   Smart Electrical Technology (for G1)
*   Upper Secondary Science (for G1)

##### Lower Secondary Science

The syllabus is a continuation of the Primary Science Syllabus and is a bridge to the pursuit of scientific studies at the upper secondary levels. The curriculum is underpinned by five themes – Scientific Endeavour, Diversity, Models, Interactions, Systems – that provide the foundational concepts that students need for the disciplinary Sciences (Biology, Chemistry and Physics) at upper secondary.

##### Biology

Biology is the study of life and provides a foundation understanding about the organisation and interactions at organismal, physiological and molecular levels.

The Upper Secondary Biology syllabus seeks to develop in students the understanding, skills, ethics and attitudes relevant to the Practices of Science, enabling them to

a) appreciate practical applications of biology in the real world,

b) deepen their interest in biology for future learning and work,

c) become scientifically literate citizens who can innovate and seize opportunities in the 21st century, and

d) develop a way of thinking to understand how living organisms work to sustain life and use the disciplinary ideas in biology to approach, analyse and solve problems in biological systems.

##### Chemistry

Chemistry is the study of matter and its changes. While chemistry seeks to understand the nature of matter by relating the study of energy and particles such as atoms and molecules in physical systems to chemical systems, it also provides a basis for studying and understanding molecules and processes in biological systems.

The Upper Secondary Chemistry syllabus seeks to develop in students the understanding, skills, ethics and attitudes relevant to the Practices of Science, enabling them to

a) appreciate practical applications of chemistry in the real world,

b) deepen their interest in chemistry for future learning and work,

c) become scientifically literate citizens who can innovate and seize opportunities in the 21st century, and

d) develop a way of thinking to approach, analyse and solve problems by explaining macroscopic characteristics and changes in chemical systems through the use of sub-microscopic and symbolic representations.

##### Physics

Physics is a science that is concerned with understanding the natural world of matter, motion and energy. A small number of basic principles and laws can be applied to explain and predict a wide range of physical events and phenomena.

The Upper Secondary Physics syllabus seeks to develop in students the understanding, skills, ethics and attitudes relevant to the Practices of Science, enabling them to

a) appreciate practical applications of physics in the real world,

b) deepen their interest in physics for future learning and work,

c) become scientifically literate citizens who can innovate and seize opportunities in the 21st century, and

d) appreciate that a small number of basic principles and disciplinary ideas can be applied to explain, analyse and solve problems in the physical world.

##### Upper Secondary Science

The syllabus is for a two-year course that is designed to provide students with an understanding of the natural and physical world around them and to equip them with a basic level of scientific knowledge and practices. It comprises three modules, namely Machines Around Us (II), Food Matters, and Our Body and Health (II), that are situated in authentic contexts students can relate to.

##### Smart Electrical Technology

The syllabus is for a two-year course where students learn about electrical principles and circuits as well as home automation system through many hands-on learning experiences.

###### The syllabus aims to:

(a) equip students with foundational knowledge of electrical circuits and systems and home automation systems in preparation for further engineering studies at post-secondary level;

(b) enable students to acquire skills and knowledge related to electrical technology and home automation that are of immediate interest, relevance and use in daily life;

(c) enable students to understand the applications of electrical and home automation technology in homes and built environments;

(d) inculcate students with safety consciousness and safe working habits;

(e) enable students to develop their analytical abilities and problem-solving skills; and

(f) develop in students an interest in a post-secondary engineering-based education.

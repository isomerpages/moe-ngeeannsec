### Special Programmes

##### NASEdventure (Digital Content Creation)

A one-day enrichment programme that focused on the authentic use of the English Language. The session kicked off with a sharing by Ms Annette Lee, a digital content creator, on how to craft social media posts that are impactful yet engaging. Subsequently, students put into practice the tips that were shared by Ms Lee by crafting a social media post of their own.

##### Debate

As a special interest group, our debaters are trained by a coach in research and information sourcing, debate strategies and styles, and rebuttal techniques. They are given opportunities to come up with debate motions as well as participate in mini debates to hone their skills. The highlight of the year for our debaters is when they represent the school in the Singapore Secondary Schools Debating Championships. 2023, in particular, was an exceptional year as one of our debaters, Jonas Lim, was awarded the best floor speaker in the Championships.

<h4><strong>Purpose of the Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) for Use of EdTech Resources</strong></h4>
<p>Technology is an essential part of learning in today’s world.</p>
<p>This Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) establishes guidelines on the appropriate
use of EdTech resources to help you understand how to use these resources
safely and responsibly, in line with efforts to develop your digital literacies
and growth as digitally responsible citizens.</p>
<p>EdTech resources include the following, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Learning devices (e.g. Personal Learning Devices (PLDs), school devices)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ICT system accounts (e.g. Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS), iCON);
and school internet networks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, please refer to: Student Kit on Cyber Wellness and
Learning with a Personal Learning Device (Secondary) – <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/cw-studentkit</a>
</p>
<h4><strong>General</strong></h4>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should not attempt to access data,
system and information that you are not authorised to.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are reminded that the use of learning
devices and school’s EdTech resources should solely be for the purpose
of learning.</p>
<h4><strong>Using your PLD</strong></h4>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are responsible for your PLD. As
the school subsidises the purchase of the personal learning device, while
you are enrolled in Ngee Ann Secondary School (NAS), the learning device
is co-owned both by you and the school. As such, any loss or suspected
theft must be reported to the school immediately in the form of a written
report with parental acknowledgement. A police report is also required
for loss and suspected theft. After you graduate or leave the school, the
device is considered to be fully owned under you and all school mandated
restrictions would be lifted from the device.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the learning device is found to have
been sold while you are still enrolled in NAS, disciplinary actions will
be taken. This includes buying back the device, purchasing a new device
from the school and/or refunding the initial subsidy in full.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to have a positive learning
experience, you should ensure that your PLD is fully charged before bringing
it to school. Should you need to charge your PLD in school, you should
only do so at the school’s designated charging stations, during recess
and/or after-school hours.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are reminded to keep your PLD updated
by installing the relevant patches and updates when being prompted by the
system.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All PLDs are installed with a Device
Management Application (DMA) to support a safe and conducive learning environment.&nbsp;
You should not attempt to bypass the DMA. &nbsp;Learning devices without
DMA would need to undergo DMA re-installation, which requires a factory
reset. While the school will work with the students to ensure all data
is backed up, there may be a possibility of data loss resulting from the
DMA reinstallation</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are responsible for regularly backing
up your learning materials in your PLD to prevent data loss.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should approach the ICT Helpdesk
located at sPACE (Level 3) for assistance regarding your PLD. Opening hours
are 1430-1630 (Mon-Thu) and 1430-1600 (Fri).</p>
<h4><strong>Being a Responsible Digital Citizen</strong></h4>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp; You should interact with others in a respectful and responsible
way. You should not post online remarks that are</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>racially and/or religiously insensitive,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>vulgar and/or offensive, or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hurtful to others.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp; You should not use any devices to</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>store, modify, create or share content (e.g. documents, presentations,
pictures and videos) that is inappropriate (e.g. indecent, pornographic,
defamatory, hurtful to self or others).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make threats, cause harassment or embarrassment, impersonate or intimidate
others.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp; You should not use MOE/school-deployed ICT system accounts
for any commercial activities (e.g. buying and selling of goods and services).</p>
<p>Non-compliance with the above will lead to disciplinary action in accordance
with the school’s discipline policy.</p>
<h4><strong>Respecting Copyright</strong></h4>
<p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp; You are reminded to obtain explicit permission from the
content owner(s) before downloading, copying or sharing any copyrighted
materials (e.g. pictures, videos, music).</p>
<p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You should not use, copy, edit or share digital
files in an unauthorised or illegal manner.</p>
<h4><strong>Using Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong></h4>
<p>15.&nbsp;&nbsp; You must ensure that you meet the minimum age requirement
specified in each AI tool's age restrictions before using it.</p>
<p>16.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the use of AI is permitted, you should acknowledge
the use of AI in weighted assessments and homework as required.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp;&nbsp; You are to practice academic integrity and be responsible
for your own learning when using AI. Understand that you are ultimately
short-changing yourself if you pass off other’s work as your own.</p>
<h4><strong>Staying Safe and Secure Online</strong></h4>
<p>18.&nbsp;&nbsp; You should report any incidents (e.g. unusual device behaviour
or inappropriate use of devices), to your teachers or the school at <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">nass_helpme_ict@moe.edu.sg</a>.</p>
<p>19.&nbsp;&nbsp; You are reminded to develop online safety habits. This
includes not disclosing personal access credentials (e.g. MIMS password,
PLD passcode), sensitive personal data (e.g. home address, passwords) online
or on AI platforms, verifying credibility of online content before sharing,
avoiding clicking on suspicious links or downloading unknown files, and
being cautious when interacting with others online (e.g. on social media)
by not engaging with strangers.</p>
<p>20.&nbsp;&nbsp; You should exercise caution regarding the limitations
of AI tools, including potential inaccuracies / fabricated responses, inherent
biases and outdated information.</p>
<h4><strong>Digital Wellbeing and Balance</strong></h4>
<p>21.&nbsp;&nbsp; You are reminded to balance screentime with other activities
including physical exercise and face-to-face social interactions.</p>
<p>22.&nbsp;&nbsp; You should avoid excessive use of your devices outside
learning hours.</p>
<p>23.&nbsp;&nbsp; You should take regular breaks to rest your eyes and mind.</p>
<p>24.&nbsp;&nbsp; You are reminded to practice good sleep hygiene by not
using your devices one hour before bedtime.</p>

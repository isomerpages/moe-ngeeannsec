<p><em>"Everybody should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you how to think.” ~</em>&nbsp;Steve
Jobs</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence will accelerate the shift in skills demand with
the workplace becoming increasingly automated. Ngee Ann’s response in anticipation
of these realities is to prepare NASians to have deep appreciation of and
capability to harness and deploy technology as part of life and work. In
other words, to be future-ready. In particular, we aim to hone NAsians’
ability in tech-based solutioning – where they simplify and abstract real
life problems into ones solvable by computers.</p>
<h3>Our Programme</h3>
<p>Code@NAS is one of our distinctive flagship programmes with the aspiration
of preparing highly adaptable NASians who can ride any wave of technological
disruptions.</p>
<p>The objectives of Code@NAS are to:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Develop Computational Thinking skills for day-to-day problem solving,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop talents with a passion for the creative process of coding to solve
problems, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Empower students to be active creators of technology to contribute and
solve problems within the community.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Programmes planned are differentiated to cater to NASians of different
academic courses and degree of readiness in coding, each with their customised
objectives.</p>

</div>
<p>NASians can expect to gain the following skills and competencies through
their 4 years in school:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Building foundational Computing skills and leveraging Design Thinking
to build tech-enabled prototype to help the community through Interdisciplinary
Project Work (IPW);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engaging interest in Programming through out of curriculum opportunities
such as Robotics and Media Club CCA and Technopreneur, our talent development
programme;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply coding and technology in a contextual manner though the Sentinel
Programme, Amazon Web Services Accelerator Programme and Swift Accelerator
Programme; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Honing their talent in development of Technology through Applied Subjects
such as ‘O’ Level Computing and Smart Electrical Technology, complemented
by learning journeys and industrial attachments for exposure to latest
developments.</p>
</li>
</ol>

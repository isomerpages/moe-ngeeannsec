Throughout your 4 years in Ngee Ann Secondary, you can expect to undergo challenges that stretch and prepare you with a variety of skills to cope with a Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambigious future. Programmes are also planned to expose you to a variety of opportunities to acquire Computational Thinking so that you would be able to translate real life problems into problems solvable by a computer. Lastly, we aim to inculcate in you a moral compass to respect others over the internet, and empower you to advocate Cyber Wellness to fellow peers and set a positive example for all to follow.

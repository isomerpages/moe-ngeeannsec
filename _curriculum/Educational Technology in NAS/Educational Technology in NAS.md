<p>Throughout your 4 years in Ngee Ann Secondary, you can expect to undergo
challenges that stretch and prepare you with a variety of skills to cope
with a Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambigious future. Programmes are
also planned to expose you to a variety of opportunities to acquire Computational
Thinking so that you would be able to translate real life problems into
problems solvable by a computer. Lastly, we aim to inculcate in you a moral
compass to respect others over the internet.</p>

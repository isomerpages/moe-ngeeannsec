## Welcome to Ngee Ann Secondary (NAS) School’s e-Open House page. 

“We know that the PSLE is a major milestone for you and that the next step of choosing the right secondary school is one of the biggest decisions you have to make. 

This year, our physical Open House falls on 18 November 2023 (Saturday), from 8am to 1pm. We have lined up many exciting programmes for our visitors, including performances by our students and augmented reality tours.

We look forward to meeting you at our physical Open House!
Can’t visit us on this date? Fret not! We will bring NAS to you via our e-Open House!)
